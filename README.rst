EQVersion
=========

The purpose of **EQVersion** is to remove the change redundancy in the project version in two places, in the **pyproject.toml** and in the **__init__.py** of the main package. **EQVersion** is especially for those who work with `Poetry`_.


Using:
------

In a project using `Poetry`_ and an active virtual environment, add **EQVersion** as a development dependency:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ poetry add eqversion --dev


Now simply run the command below for the versions to be matched:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ eqversion

**Specifying a package:**

By default, **EQVersion** takes the name of the main package via **pyproject.toml**, in the key **name**, but it may happen that the name of the main package is not the same as in **pyproject.toml**. If this happens, the **--package** option should be used to specify the main package:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ eqversion --package=<PACKAGE MAIN NAME>

Using with tests:

You must call **EQVersion** before performing your tests.

Example of `tox.ini` file:

.. code-block:: ini

    [tox]
    isolated_build = True
    
    [testenv]
    setenv =
        PYTHONPATH = {toxinidir}
    deps =
        poetry
    commands =
        pip install --upgrade pip
        poetry install
        poetry run eqversion
    ;   Or use the named option:
    ;   poetry run eqversion --package=<PACKAGE MAIN NAME>
        poetry run pytest --basetemp={envtmpdir}
